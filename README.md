# Mom's website

https://marielle-tuil-bensimon.fr (in French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·)

## Tech choices

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - For this kind of website, static generation at build time is the most effective (good SEO out of the box, easy hosting, etc.). Gatsby is one of the most popular tool to build static websites with React. The huge plugin library is very useful. I could very easily lazy-load images using [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/). 
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) - Wanted to try CSS-in-JS.
